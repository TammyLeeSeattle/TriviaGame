## Week 5 Homework

#### Overview
Who doesn't like timed quizzes? Everyone loves them! (Just kidding.) This is game to test your trivia knowledge, but there's a catch -- you'll have to answer all of the questions before the timer runs out! If not, well, the trivia will end and you'll live in perpetual curiousity!

And there's just one more catch -- some of the answers are "subjective". Don't worry about your final score -- just love dogs. That's what we should all do :)

#### Instructions

Check out the quiz here: [https://tammyleeseattle.github.io/TriviaGame/](https://tammyleeseattle.github.io/TriviaGame/)

To get started, click the "Start" button -- this will allow you to see the questions. When you've answered them all, or as many as you can in the time you have, click "Done" at the bottom.

- If you finish before the timer runs out, then you'll see how many questions you answered correctly and incorrectly.
- If you finish after the timer runs out, then you'll be automatically shown how many questions you answered correctly and incorrectly.

Good luck in your trivia adventures, and remember, love all the dogs <3
